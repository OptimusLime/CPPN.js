CPPN.js
=======

Compositional Pattern Producing Networks, now in a javascript library near you!

Tests are run through Mocha and should.js. Activation functions and cppns are tested against the HyperNEAT C# code from Sebastian Risi's work.

This library is used by the neatjs library and the winjs library as well.
