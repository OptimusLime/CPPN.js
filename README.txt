NEAT.js is a conversion from Colin Green's C# (Hyper-)NEAT work. 

I'm most familiar with this C# code, so I thought the conversion to Javascript would be easier. I'm trying to maintain the code structure as well.

I'm not expecting much from performance to begin with, but it should get better over time.
